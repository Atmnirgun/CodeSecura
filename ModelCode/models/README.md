# Models

Due to the size of models, we store the model files separately from GitHub.

## How to download the pre-trained model (VulBERTa)

1. Download the compressed file from (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VB1jR-S6F2PbQsqpVua7rw-M9Z3TIcVi/view?usp=drive_link)  
	
3. Unzip the compressed file in this directory (e.g. models)  
`unzip pretraining_model.zip`

4. This will extract 1 folder: `CodeSecura`
5. Now, you can use this pre-trained model to fine-tune on a specific vulnerability detection dataset.
